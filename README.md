# renda_assessment_app

Setup and Installation
-
1. Install Dependencies: flutter pub get
2. Run the App: flutter run


Architectural approach : The application follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, 
which promotes a clear separation of concerns, making the code more modular, testable, and scalable.
State management :Flutter Riverpod inline with riverpod annotation
Local storage : Shared preference was used effectively throughout the app for storing of data locally.

Other packages Used:

google_fonts: a fonts api provider
flutter_animate: for smooth animations in the application
flutter_svg: for displaying SVG assets properly
riverpod_annotation: offers a simpler syntax for the riverpod provider by relying on code generation 
dotted_line
flutter_screenutil for managing media queries in a detailed way
skeletonizer: for managing loading state on the pages to give the pages a smooth transition once the data is fetched 
http: Future-based library for making HTTP client requests
